# Super-Resolution GAN Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to enhance image quality through super-resolution.

## Project Overview

The Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN) model enhances the resolution of images by a factor of 2x within just 15 epochs. This project utilizes the VGG19 model architecture for image enhancement and quality optimization.
